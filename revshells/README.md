This is a script that prints out most common and useful Reverse Shells
Idea taken from Solstice VM - Walkthrough with S1REN https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ6jbKqkJ0s&list=PLJrSyRNlZ2EeqkJa12Tu-Ezun9kXvHufN&index=3

The script uses an ifconfig interace parameter to automatically fill in your local host IP address. You can then copy and paste a Reverse shell that fits your needs
